    <p>An Italian food menu just wouldn’t be complete without lasagna listed on it. The dish is a dinner favorite at Earth, Wind & Flour, other restaurants, and many households across the world.</p>

    <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years. The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between. It is then baked before being served.</p>

        <li><a href="bolognese.html">Bolognese sauce</a></li>
        <li><p>1 Package of lasagna noodles</p></li>
        <li><p>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p></li>

        <li><p>3 Eggs</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Gather all the Ingredients</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodle in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Then, drain the noodles, and rinse with cold water</p></li>
        <li><p>In a mixing bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the eggs and 1/2 teaspoons of salt</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees farenheit or 190 degrees celcius</p></li>
        <li><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>
        <li><p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
