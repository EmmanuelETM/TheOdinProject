    <h1>Bolognese Sauce</h1>

    <p>Bolognese sauce is a classic Italian sauce for pasta made with ground meat such as beef or pork. This sauce comes from the Bologna region of Italy, hence the name. Given the cultural history of this sauce, there are many variations, but they all seem to follow a basic structure of ground meat, a soffritto, a bit of tomato, some milk, and long, slow cooking.</p>

    <p>Bologna, in north-central Italy, is the main city of Emilia-Romagna, a region that some say produces the best food in the country. Emilia-Romagna is renowned for its rich production of cattle and grain and, with its mild climate, a cornucopia of vegetables as well—which contribute to ragù alla Bolognese, or Bolognese sauce. There is no single canonical recipe, and chefs and cookbook writers differ widely on its exact constituents, but two ingredients are essential to its classic version: coarsely ground or chopped beef and tomatoes. The ragù also typically includes olive oil and butter. Beyond that, some cooks advocate simplicity, while others are not shy about adding numerous amendments.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the 1 hour has passed, it is ready to serve on some pasta or you can make lasagna with.</p></li>
